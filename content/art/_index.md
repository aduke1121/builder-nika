I've been making film and video art since 2002.

I value a patient sense of beauty. I often combine landscape photography, subtle sound design, and portraiture to invoke internal states responsive to political and historical forces. My work has been screened internationally.

I'm currently in the process of migrating all my art stuff to this new site. Stay tuned!
