I've been making film and video art since 2002.

I value a patient sense of beauty. I often combine landscape photography, subtle sound design, and portraiture to invoke internal states responsive to political and historical forces. My work has been screened internationally.

In addition to short-form writing and films, I recently expanded into opera by writing my first commissioned libretto, which led to stage and video direction of a new video work coming soon.

I'm a currently in the process of migrating all my art stuff to this new site. Stay tuned!
