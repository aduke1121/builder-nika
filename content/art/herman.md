## Reprise

The online program Reprise reactivated the Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery’s public programming archives through a series of responses to selected events from the past decade (2010-2019). In a bimonthly dispatch from May to August, each iteration invited a guest proximate to a past event—either directly involved in its realization, witness to it, or in dialogue with it at the time—to reflect on the stakes in reviewing and renewing the ideas, positions and conversations from the standpoint of today.

Reprise sought to promote a dialogue between the past and the present by linking audio and video documentation of a lecture, performance, or discussion with critical writing and retrospective study.
