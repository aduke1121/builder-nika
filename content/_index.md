Hi hi. I'm Nika, an [artist](/art) and trauma [therapist](/therapy) working in Tiohtià:ke / Montréal.

I was born in Isfahan, raised in Houston, skooled in NYC, and have lived all over.

- March 7th: I began my term as the resident SEP (trauma therapist) at [Long Spell Clinic](https://www.longspell.com)
- My [opera](http://smcq.qc.ca/smcq/fr/evenement/43749/Triptyque_Mécénat_Musica_Prix_3_Femmes) that I wrote the libretto for and in collaboration with composer Parisa Sabet. This piece was almost two years in production and I am so proud of the whole cast and crew. Stay tuned for the film adaptation of Vanishing Point!
