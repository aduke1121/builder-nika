Somatic Experiencing (SE)™️ is a gentle step-by-step approach to the renegotiation of trauma.

My goal in this work is to help clients:
- increase resilience
 - resolve trauma symptoms
 - expand pleasure
 - get curious / stay curious

I work 1:1 with clients, in-person in Montreal and online.

I also facilitate group workshops, particularly on the role of nervous system regulation in social justice work.

I'm proud to be working with Gina Badger at Long Spell Clinic as the resident somatics practitioner. Check out the [website](https://longspell.com/) and the beautiful [IG page](https://www.instagram.com/longspellclinic/) that's chock-a-block with good info.
