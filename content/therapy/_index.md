Somatic experiencing (SE) is a method of alternative therapy for treating trauma and stressor-related disorders like PTSD. The primary goal of SE is to modify the trauma-related stress response through bottom-up processing.

I started my training in 2020, and will be fully certified in spring of 2023.

I am currently seeing patients at a reduced rate while I complete my training.

I'd love to talk about what you're working on.
