Nika Khanjani (Persian: نیکا خانجانی), is an Iranian-Canadian writer and video artist based in Montreal. She is a follower of the Baháʼí Faith. She began making short experimental and essay films in 2006. Her titles include Free World Pens (2015), Iran to Texas (2011), Texas, My Brother, and Me (2009), Current (2007), Copyright (2006), and Montreal spring, shrouded in mist (2012).

She explores her own memories and family history to explore broader themes of displacement and social struggle. The autobiographic poetics of her films are often contrasted with imagery of empty or sparsely populated spaces and layered soundscapes.
