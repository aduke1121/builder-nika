Nika Khanjani (Persian: نیکا خانجانی), is an Iranian-American-Canadian artist and SEP based in Montreal.

I continue my studio practice and making commissioned works, alongside a  private practice as a trauma therapist.

I'm raising a spirited kid with my husband, a Ukrainian-Albertan who sacrificed the wide prairie skies for urban life for me, for now.
