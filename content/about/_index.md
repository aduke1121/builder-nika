Nika Khanjani (Persian: نیکا خانجانی), is an Iranian-American-Canadian multidisciplinary storyteller and SEP, working as an immigrant-guest on unceded Kanien’kehá:ka Territory (Montreal).

I pull from my lived experience as an immigrant growing up in a diverse working-class community to tell stories of human resilience and how we heal from adversity.

I continue my studio practice and making commissioned works, alongside a  private practice as a trauma therapist.

I'm raising a spirited kid with my husband, a Ukrainian-Albertan who sacrificed the wide prairie skies for urban life for me, for now.
